You must install the file on your PC or laptop.
Then just open it as administrator. Then this small bat file will do everything for you. 

Re-activation of Windows is possible,
it will be required 180 days after the first activation.

If you wish, you can change the file extension from .bat to .txt and see what lines I used in writing this file.
Thank you for your attention.
